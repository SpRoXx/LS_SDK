JoinType
Clipper.JoinType
Official Documentation
note
The JoinType enumeration is only needed when offsetting (inflating/shrinking). It isn't needed for polygon clipping. It specifies how to manage offsetting at convex angled joins. Concave joins will always be offset with a mitered join.
When adding paths to a ClipperOffset object via the AddPaths method, the JoinType parameter must specify one of the following types - Miter, Square or Round.
caution
Bevel is not supported in LS implementation of Clipper.
