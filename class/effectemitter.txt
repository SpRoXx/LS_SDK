EffectEmitter :
GameObject
Effect object. Inherited from GameObject.
tip
These properies are useful to identify EffectEmitter object by their key rather than by object name.
Example​
Identifying Syndra Q Gather objects
local SyndraQGatherKey = 3075502988         -- Syndra_Base_Q_2021_aoe_gather, Syndra_Skin01_Q_aoe_gather, etc  
local SyndraQGatherLv5Key = 3214691578      -- Syndra_Base_Q_Lv5_aoe_gather  
Callback.Bind(CallbackType.OnObjectCreate, function(object)  
    if not object or not object:IsValid() then return end  
    if object.type ~= ObjectType.obj_GeneralParticleEmitter then return end

    local source = object.effectSourceFirst and object.effectSourceFirst:IsValid() and object.effectSourceFirst

    if source and source.isEnemy and (effectKey == SyndraQGatherKey or effectKey == SyndraQGatherLv5Key) then  
        -- ...  
    end  
end)
Properties​
effectKey
: number​
Unique effect key. This key is the same for different versions of EffectEmitter object despite the skin and hostility.
effectSourceList
:
GameObject
[] - std::vector<
GameObject
>​
A list of sources. Apparently each EffectEmitter can have multiple sources.
effectSourceFirst
:
GameObject
​
First source of this EffectEmitter. Added for convenience.
